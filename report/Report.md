I ran an overlap check between high coverage novel kmers (>5x) for each deletion in the pool. Here are the results:

![](/Users/parsoakhorsand/Desktop/Davis/Projects/NebulousSerendipity/report/images/1.png)

There are 9 deletions here which overlap with others completely, we check a few of them in the IGV:

* chr11_95169380_95175427 (chr11	95436216 95442263)
* chr18_18512404_18517090 (chr18	20932443 20937129)
* chr6_133341834_133347885 (chr6	133020695 133026746)
